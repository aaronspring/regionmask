  description: The Marine Ecoregions Of the World (MEOW) data set is a biogeographic classification of the worlds coasts and shelves. The ecoregions nest within the broader biogeographic tiers of Realms and Provinces. Further details about the MEOW system and PDFs of the BioScience paper the comprehensive listing of sources are available from www.worldwildlife.org/MEOW/ and www.nature.org/MEOW.

  description: The Freshwater Ecoregions Of the World (FEOW) provide a global biogeographic regionalization of the Earths freshwater biodiversity. This version of the FEOW, modified by The Nature Conservancy, includes additional tabular data describing Major Habitat Types (MHTs, similar to terrestrial biomes, but unpublished).You can read more about the FEOW, and obtain the unmodified shapefile at www.feow.org.

  description: This is the master spatial data layer for TNCs terrestrial ecoregions of the world, exported from the geodatabase listed above. Note that it includes Mangroves, Inland Water, and Rock and Ice MHTs, although they are not being handled by terrestrial assessments. This layer is based on WWFs ecoregions outside the United States, and loosely based on Baileys ecoregions (from the USDA Forest Service) within the United States.
